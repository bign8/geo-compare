# [Geo Compare](http://bign8.github.io/geo-compare/)
*Geographic Comparison Tool* 

This tool was designed to allow a user to create lists of various locations and be able to toggle through them.

Lists can be added by clicking the `edit` link.  Once the desired changes have been made, the `view` link can be used to return to the item viewings.

To add an item to a list, search for a location via the *search box* in the top left corner.  Once a destination has been found, click on the location's icon and a green `+` button will appear next to all the lists titles (bottom right).  Click the `+` next to the name of the desired destination list.

Removing an item from a list is as easy as clicking the red `x` next to a particular location.

Lists can be expanded or contracted by clicking the up and down arrows next to a list name.
